### What is Google Cloud Platform?

[Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) (GCP) is a cloud computing
platform by Google. It provides many computing, networking, and storage
services.

### How to set up a Google Cloud Platform project?

Some of the tutorials will use Google Cloud, and there will be a Google employee
on-site to give guidance if you choose to use Google Cloud for your hackathon
project.

To use Google Cloud, you will need to activate the Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
services using a normal Google account.

#### Activate Google Cloud Platform for your account

The first step to using GCP is to enable it for your Google account:

1.  Navigate to [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2.  Ensure you are logged in to a Gmail/G Suite for Education account that has
    access to GCP by clicking the "person" icon at the top right.

    If your school is a G Suite for Education school, your school email address
    will only work with GCP if your G Suite for Education administrator has
    turned on the Developer Console.  By default it is off, so if you haven't
    used GCP from your G Suite for Education account, it's safer to use a Gmail
    account instead.
3.  Answer the questions as you wish and accept the terms of service.

#### Set up a billing account

Most Google Cloud services, such as Google Compute Engine, require a billing
account to function. To create a billing account, start a free trial.

-   When you start the free trial, it will ask for a credit card. This is to
    prevent fraud. No charges will be made to your account.

    Even if you use up your free trial, no charges will be made until you
    manually reenable the billing account to allow charges.

### How do I use Google Cloud Platform?

Some tutorials will cover using various Google Cloud Platform services, but
there are also many materials available for self-learning.

#### Codelabs

Google provides [codelabs](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/?cat=Cloud),
which are guided tutorials. For example:

-   [Creating a virtual machine](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cloud-create-a-vm/index.html?index=..%2F..%2Findex#0) - This codelab walks you through how to create a virtual machine using
    Google Compute Engine.
-   [Getting started with Cloud Shell and gcloud](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cloud-shell/index.html?index=..%2F..%2Findex#0) - This codelab walks you through using Cloud Shell and the Google Cloud SDK,
    which is a command-line environment for managing Google Cloud Platform projects.

#### Documentation

The reference documentation for GCP is hosted on [cloud.google.com](https://cloud.google.com/).
